So you've got your `webdriver` setup down. Great.  
Now what? You want to **stop writing the same setup/teardown crap** in every test?

Thatâ€™s where **Pytest fixtures** come in.

---

## What's a Fixture?

A fixture is your pre-test butler.  
It sets things up, hands the keys to your test, then quietly cleans up.

```python
import pytest
from selenium import webdriver

@pytest.fixture
def driver():
    options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()
    options.add_argument('--headless')
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=options)
    yield driver
    driver.quit()
```

---

## Why Use Fixtures?

- ðŸ’¥ **No repetition** â€“ one setup, reused across tests.
- ðŸ§¼ **Automatic cleanup** â€“ no browser zombies.
- ðŸ§ª **Customizable scopes** â€“ per function, class, module, you name it.

---

## Real-Life Test

```python
def test_page_load(driver):
    driver.get("https://example.com")
    assert "Example" in driver.title
```

Simple, clean, effective. No boilerplate. Just test logic.

---

## Advanced Moves?

- Use `scope='session'` to share a browser across multiple tests.
- Parametrize fixtures for different environments or browsers.
- Chain fixtures together like a QA ninja stacking buffs.

---

## TL;DR

Stop copy-pasting your setup like itâ€™s 2009.

Use fixtures.  
Keep your tests clean.  
Keep your sanity.
