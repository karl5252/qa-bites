Welcome to the wild side of test automation. No fluff, no filler â€“ letâ€™s start where the browser starts: **WebDriver options**.

You donâ€™t just launch a browser. You tell it **how** to launch.

```python
options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()
options.add_argument('--headless')
driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=options)
```

Think of this as coffee for your browser â€“ wake it up the way you want.

## Key Options â€“ When and Why?

- `--headless`: Run without GUI. Fast, CI-friendly, and quiet.
- `--disable-gpu`: Skip GPU acceleration â€“ avoid weird rendering bugs.
- `--window-size=1920,1080`: Control screen size. Critical for responsive UI tests.
- `--no-sandbox`: Required in some containerized environments. Use responsibly.
- `--disable-dev-shm-usage`: Prevent crashes in environments with limited shared memory.
- `--ignore-certificate-errors`: When staging has expired SSLs. Use with caution.
- `--disable-extensions`: Clean browser, no funny business.

---

## Do you need all of them?

Nope. Use what makes sense for your test environment. Too many flags = configuration soup.

---

## TL;DR

- `--headless`: Default for CI.
- `--window-size`: Essential for layout validation.
- `--no-sandbox`, `--disable-dev-shm-usage`: Required for Docker-based test runners.
