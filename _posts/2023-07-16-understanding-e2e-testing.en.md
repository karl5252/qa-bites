excerpt: When testing a web and desktop app that share the same API, full E2E automation might be a dream. Here's how to stay sane and still cover your bases.

> "One does not simply automate across platforms." — every frustrated QA ever

So here's the deal: you’ve got a web app (App A), a desktop app (App B), and they both sip data from the same API tap. What could go wrong? Oh, only *everything*.

This kind of architecture *sounds* elegant. But when QA gets involved, it turns into a spaghetti-fueled test strategy panic.

## 🤯 The Core Question

Recently a software architect hit me with:

> _“How do we ensure proper testing coverage between our web and desktop apps?”_

Translation:  
_"How do we test two UIs written in different tech stacks, deployed on different platforms, with the same backend, and no time?"_

Answer: very carefully.

## 🚧 Reality Check

Automating desktop UI is like teaching a toaster to do calculus. Sure, maybe with enough duct tape, pywinauto, and pain, you *can* – but should you?

Let’s be honest:
- Desktop automation is brittle.
- It hates CI/CD pipelines.
- And good luck debugging Electron when it hangs silently during step 3 of your test.

---

## 🔧 The Sanity Stack

Here’s what *does* work:

- 🧪 **Web App (App A)**: Automate UI flows.
- 🔄 **API**: Test the data contract. Validate state and sync.
- 🧍 **Desktop App (App B)**: Manual tests + sanity flows + exploratory.

The API is your ally. Treat it like a contract test for both frontends.

## ✅ API as Source of Truth

If:
- App A updates data via API,
- and App B reads the same data correctly,
- and you validated the payload in between...

Then guess what? 🎉 That’s an end-to-end test. You just skipped the flaky bits.

---

## 🧠 Bonus: Work With Devs

Ask devs for:
- `data-testid` attributes in UI
- Dev-only debug endpoints
- Consistent identifiers

You give them clean bug reports. They give you automation handles. Everyone wins.

---

## TL;DR

Full E2E across web and desktop is the QA equivalent of chasing unicorns with a butterfly net.

Here’s the smart approach:
- Automate web UI (because you can).
- Validate API behavior (because it's shared).
- Manually test the desktop frontend (because it’s cursed).
- Sync with devs (because they hold the keys to automation).

No fairy tales. Just practical, risk-based QA.
