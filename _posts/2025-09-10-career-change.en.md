# ✨ New Chapter, New Project, Same Drive

From January to July, I was part of an e-commerce project for a major client in the beverage industry —  
that's where my **romance with TypeScript and Playwright** really took off.  
After years of working in C# and SpecFlow, it felt like a literal breath of fresh air.

Meanwhile, after hours, I've been digging deeper into **Phaser** —  
experimenting, testing, sometimes even finishing things 😉.

And so, a new change came naturally.  
I've recently joined a new team as a **Senior Software Engineer in Test**, this time working in a **JavaScript + Pixie.js** stack.  
Finally, I get to build something **visually exciting** — not just after work, but as part of my job.

I don’t know yet what exactly this project will bring.  
But I do know one thing:

> **This is the direction I want to go now.**
