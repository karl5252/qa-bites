# 📉 Four QA Engineers. One Framework. Zero Continuity.

Over the past few years, the project has seen **four QA engineers** come and go.  
Only one of them built something sustainable.  

The rest — for various reasons — didn’t deliver.  

This isn’t just a story about team rotation.  
It’s a **diagnosis of a project** that:

- doesn’t support its people,  
- doesn’t evolve its processes,  
- and has no real strategy for QA.

## 📌 QA #1 — *The TOSCA Dream, Zero Delivery*

- Mission: create automation using **TOSCA**.  
- Result after a full year:

  - no tests,  
  - no framework,  
  - nothing maintainable.  

- Conclusion:  
  Started in the wrong direction + no results = nothing to show.

---

## 📌 QA #2 — *From Scratch to Stable*

- Started from **scratch**, with zero inherited code.
- Delivered:

  - 🔧 A framework in **C# + Playwright + SpecFlow (BDD)**  
  - 🐍 Python scripts for managing test environments  
  - ⚙️ CI pipelines  
  - 📚 QA handover: documentation, wiki, OneNote  
  - 📈 ~270 scenarios organized into modules  

- Used in production.  
- Stable.  
- Built and maintained solo.

---

## 📌 QA #3 — *Lost in Setup*

- Came in with experience, but…

  - Spent **2 months stuck** on environment setup.  
  - Delivered **zero tests**.  
  - Added no measurable value.

---

## 📌 QA #4 — *Six Months In, Still No Delivery*

- Despite full documentation and a working framework:

  - ❌ No new automation  
  - ❌ No refactor  
  - ❌ Test execution problems dragged on for months  

- Memorable quotes:

  > *“I don’t know what to do. There’s no tutorial.”*  
  > *“I don’t like reading documentation.”*

- Instead of leveraging existing scenarios and steps,  
  there was a constant urge to “rewrite everything from scratch”.

- End result?  
  **No regression. Bugs went live. QA faded out.**

---

# 🎯 Summary

- Three QA engineers delivered nothing.  
- One QA delivered everything.  

And the project?  
It learned **nothing**:

- No support.  
- No clear QA roadmap.  
- No decisions on automation ownership or strategy.

## 🧠 The real problem?

If QA is **always** the problem in your project,  
maybe the problem isn’t QA at all —  
**maybe it’s the project itself and how it treats QA.**
