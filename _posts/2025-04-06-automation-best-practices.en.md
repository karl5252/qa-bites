Writing tests that are easy to understand, maintain, and actually tell you something when they fail?  
**Yes, it's possible.** And it starts here.

Here's a no-bullshit guide to test automation best practices.

---

## 🎯 1. One test = one purpose

A test isn't a buffet.  
Keep it focused. One feature, one scenario, one outcome.

**❌ Bad:**
```python
def test_login_and_change_password_and_logout():
    ...
```

**✅ Good:**
```python
def test_login_successful():
    ...

def test_password_change():
    ...
```

---

## 🔍 2. Use names that *actually mean something*

If your test is called `test1`, you should feel bad.  
Tests are code. And code should communicate.

Name your tests like they matter:

```python
def test_login_fails_with_invalid_credentials():
    ...
```

---

## 🧪 3. Use fixtures, don’t copy-paste setup

Copy-pasting setup code is how your test suite becomes a dumpster fire.

`@pytest.fixture` is your cleanup crew. Use it.

---

## 🪓 4. Hardcoded values? Just don’t.

Hardcoded URLs, passwords, selectors – future-you hates this.

Use config files, environment variables, or parametrize.

---

## 🧱 5. Keep structure: Arrange – Act – Assert

Don't write tests like you're playing darts drunk.  
Structure it.

```python
# Arrange
driver.get("https://example.com")

# Act
login(driver, "user", "pass")

# Assert
assert "Welcome" in driver.page_source
```

---

## 🧼 6. Clean up (yes, really)

Leaving browser instances open is a crime.  
Use `yield` in fixtures. Call `driver.quit()`.

Be a decent dev.

---

## 🛠️ 7. Use waits smartly, skip the sleeps

`time.sleep(5)` is for amateurs.

Use **WebDriverWait** and proper retry logic. Your tests will thank you later.

---

## 🧙‍♂️ 8. Write tests like someone else will read them

...because someone will.  
Or you, six months from now.

Readable code. Occasional comment. Don't be cryptic.

---

## 🐍 9. Stick to conventions

`test_` prefix, readable assertions, clear structure – just follow the rules. Pytest has them for a reason.

---

## 🧩 10. Test what matters

Don't test the "OK" button just because it's there.  
Ask yourself: **"What’s the risk if this breaks?"**  
If the answer is *meh* – skip it.

---

## TL;DR

✅ One test, one purpose  
✅ Names matter  
✅ Setup = fixtures  
✅ No hardcoded garbage  
✅ Tests = readable code

Write tests you won't curse at later.
